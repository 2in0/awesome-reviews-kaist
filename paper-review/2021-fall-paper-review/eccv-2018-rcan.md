##  1. Problem definition

기존의 CNN 기반 초해상화 (Super-Resolution, SR) 기법은 i) 층이 깊어질수록 학습이 어려우며, ii) 저해상도 (Low Resolution, LR) 이미지에 포함된 저주파(low-frequency) 정보가 모든 채널에서 동등하게 다루어짐으로써 각 feature map의 대표성이 약화된다는 한계점을 가지고 있다. i)과 ii)의 한계점을 극복하기 위해, 해당 논문에서는 Deep-RCAN (Residual Channel Attention Networks)을 제안한다.
